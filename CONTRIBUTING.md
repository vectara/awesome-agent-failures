- Anonymize sensitive information

### üîß 2. Propose Mitigation Strategies
Share solutions and prevention techniques:
- Describe implementation details
- Link to GitHub repositories with working examples
- Reference related academic work where possible

### üìä 3. Contribute Research
Add academic insights and empirical studies:
- Link to relevant papers and studies
- Summarize key findings
- Discuss practical implications
- Suggest future research directions

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. Build Tools
Develop diagnostic and monitoring utilities:
- Failure detection tools
- Mitigation frameworks
- Evaluation benchmarks
- Visualization utilities

## üìã Submission Guidelines

### For Failure Cases
**Add your example directly to the appropriate failure mode file in `docs/failure-modes/`:**

1. **Choose the Right File**: 
   - `tool-hallucination.md` - for tool output errors
   - `response-hallucination.md` - for agent response errors  
   - `goal-misinterpretation.md` - for wrong objective cases
   - `plan-generation.md` - for flawed planning
   - `tool-use.md` - for incorrect tool selection/usage
   - `verification-termination.md` - for completion failures
   - `prompt-injection.md` - for security bypass cases

2. **Include Required Information**:
   - **Scenario**: Context and setup - what was the agent supposed to do?
   - **Failure**: What went wrong and what the agent did
   - **Impact**: Consequences - financial loss, incorrect outputs, etc.
   - **Source**: Link to publicly verifiable documentation (required)

3. **Follow Existing Format**: Use the pattern `### Company/Product Description (Date)` and match the structure of existing examples

### For Mitigation Strategies
**Add to existing failure mode documentation or create new tool documentation:**

1. **For Detection/Mitigation Techniques**: Add to the "Detection and Mitigation Strategies" section of the relevant failure mode file
2. **For Tools**: Create new documentation in `docs/tools/` following the standard structure (Overview, Key Features, Pricing, Additional Resources)
3. **Include Required Information**:
   - Clear description of your approach and why it works
   - Link to working GitHub repository with implementation
   - When the technique is most effective
   - Performance/effectiveness data if available

### For Research & Tools
- **Research**: Add to README Resources section with brief description highlighting practical insights
- **Tools**: Link to external GitHub repositories with comprehensive documentation
- **Ensure**: All external repositories have proper README, usage instructions, and dependencies listed

- Use consistent terminology matching existing documentation
- Include specific dates, company names, and quantifiable impacts where possible
- Anonymize sensitive information while maintaining educational value

**Required vs. Optional Fields:**
- **Required Information**: All submission guidelines above must be followed
- **Optional**: Additional context, metrics, or analysis that enhances understanding
- **Conditional**: Some fields may be required based on contribution type (e.g., GitHub links for tools)
