# Vanderbilt University ChatGPT Email Controversy - February 2023

## Incident Overview

**Institution**: Vanderbilt University Peabody College (Tennessee)  
**Date**: February 17, 2023  
**Failure Mode**: [Goal Misinterpretation](../failure-modes/goal-misinterpretation.md) / [Incorrect Tool Use](../failure-modes/tool-use.md)  
**Impact**: Public outrage, administrative leave for staff, policy changes  
**Scope**: University-wide communication to student body

## What Happened

Following a tragic mass shooting at Michigan State University that killed three students and injured five others on February 13, 2023, Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of Education sent an email to students expressing condolences and addressing the impact of the tragedy.

The email appeared heartfelt and appropriate, discussing community support and creating inclusive environments. However, students noticed something deeply troubling at the bottom: a citation crediting ChatGPT as the source.

**The Attribution Line**: "Paraphrase from OpenAI's ChatGPT AI language model, personal communication, February 15, 2023"

## The Email Content

### The Message
The Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) at Peabody College sent this email with the subject line addressing the Michigan State shooting:

> "The recent Michigan shootings are a tragic reminder of the importance of taking care of each other, particularly in the context of creating inclusive environments. As members of the Peabody campus community, we must reflect on the impact of such an event and take steps to ensure that we are doing our best to create a safe and inclusive environment for all."

The email continued with generic language about community support and togetherness, typical of institutional responses to tragedies.

### The Problem
The email was signed by three administrators:
- **Nicole Joseph** (Associate Dean)
- **Hasina Mohyuddin** (Assistant Dean) 
- **The Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion**

But the content was generated by ChatGPT, with the AI attribution left visible in the final email sent to students.

## Student and Community Response

### Immediate Outrage

**Laith Kayat**, a Vanderbilt senior whose sister attends Michigan State, called the use of ChatGPT "disgusting."

**Kayat's Statement**: "There is a sick and twisted irony to making a computer write your message about community and togetherness because you can't be bothered to reflect on it yourself."

### Student Newspaper Coverage

Students told the editor-in-chief of *The Vanderbilt Hustler* that "they are outraged about this situation and confused as to what prompted administrators to turn to ChatGPT to write their message about the Michigan State shooting."

The incident became a symbol of institutional detachment and the inappropriate use of AI in sensitive human contexts.

### Social Media Reaction

The incident spread rapidly across social media platforms, with many expressing disbelief that a university would use AI to respond to a human tragedy involving loss of life.

## Administrative Response

### Initial Reaction

The email was sent on Friday, February 17, 2023. By the next day, the backlash was significant enough to warrant an immediate response from university leadership.

### The Apology

**Nicole Joseph**, one of the three original signatories, sent an apology email the following day, calling the use of ChatGPT "poor judgment."

**Joseph's Apology**: "While we believe in the message of inclusivity expressed in the email, using ChatGPT to generate communications on behalf of our community in a time of sorrow and in response to a tragedy contradicts the values that characterize Peabody College."

### Dean's Response

**Dean Camilla Benbow** revealed that the controversial email was never reviewed by her office before distribution, indicating a breakdown in normal communication protocols.

**Dean Benbow's Statement**: 
- "The development and distribution of the initial email did not follow Peabody's normal processes providing for multiple layers of review before being sent."
- "As dean of the college, I remain personally saddened by the loss of life and injuries at Michigan State, which I know have affected members of our own community."
- "I am also deeply troubled that a communication from my administration so missed the crucial need for personal connection and empathy during a time of tragedy."

### Administrative Consequences

The dean's office conducted an investigation into the incident, and **Associate Dean Joseph and Assistant Dean Mohyuddin were placed on temporary leave** during the investigation.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Goal Misinterpretation

1. **Misunderstood Communication Purpose**
   - Staff treated a condolence message as a routine administrative communication
   - Failed to recognize the deeply personal and emotional nature of tragedy response
   - Optimized for efficiency rather than empathy and human connection

2. **Inappropriate Tool Selection**
   - Used AI for a task requiring genuine human emotion and reflection
   - Prioritized speed of response over authenticity of sentiment
   - Failed to consider the symbolic importance of personal expression in crisis

### Process Failures

1. **Lack of Review Process**
   - Email bypassed normal review procedures that might have caught the AI attribution
   - No oversight for communications regarding sensitive topics
   - Unclear approval workflows for crisis communications

2. **AI Use Without Guidelines**
   - No institutional policies governing AI use in official communications
   - Staff unprepared to handle AI-generated content appropriately
   - Lack of training on when AI use is appropriate vs. inappropriate

### Cultural Disconnect

1. **Institutional vs. Human Response**
   - University bureaucracy prioritized process over personal connection
   - Administrative efficiency valued over emotional authenticity
   - Disconnect between institutional values (community, empathy) and actions

## Company Response

### Immediate Actions Taken

**Vanderbilt University** took the following documented steps after the backlash:

1. **Public Apology**: The Peabody College issued a formal apology acknowledging the inappropriateness of using AI for the tragic event response
2. **Message Retraction**: The university retracted the AI-generated email and acknowledged it was insensitive
3. **Leadership Accountability**: Administrators took responsibility for the poor judgment in using ChatGPT for crisis communication

### What the University Acknowledged

In their apology, Vanderbilt officials recognized:

1. **Inappropriate Tool Choice**: Using AI for responding to a mass shooting was fundamentally inappropriate
2. **Lack of Human Empathy**: The message failed to convey genuine human concern and institutional values
3. **Community Trust Damage**: The incident damaged trust with students, faculty, and the broader community
4. **Need for Better Policies**: The university acknowledged the need for clearer guidelines on AI use in communications

### No Specific Technical Changes Disclosed

The university did not publicly detail:
- Specific new policies implemented regarding AI use
- Technical safeguards added to prevent similar incidents
- Training programs for staff on appropriate AI usage
- Formal AI governance structures established

## Impact Analysis

### Core Issues Identified

1. **Tool Inappropriate for Context**: AI was used for communication requiring deep human empathy and institutional authenticity
2. **Lack of Human Review**: The AI-generated content was sent without adequate human oversight and reflection
3. **Attribution Error**: Including "Paraphrase from OpenAI's ChatGPT" in official crisis communication
4. **Poor Judgment**: Administrative decision-making failed to consider the emotional and symbolic importance of the response

### Broader Implications

1. **Authenticity in Crisis**: Communities expect genuine, human-authored responses to tragedies
2. **AI Limitations**: Current AI cannot replicate human empathy, institutional memory, or authentic emotional connection
3. **Trust and Technology**: Inappropriate AI use can severely damage institutional trust and credibility
4. **Leadership Responsibility**: Human leaders must take ownership of institutional communications, especially during crises
