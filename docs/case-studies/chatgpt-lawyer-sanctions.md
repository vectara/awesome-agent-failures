# ChatGPT Lawyer Sanctions - Mata v. Avianca (2023)

## Incident Overview

**Case**: Mata v. Avianca Airlines  
**Date**: June 2023  
**Lawyers**: Steven Schwartz & Peter LoDuca (Levidow, Levidow & Oberman)  
**Failure Mode**: [Tool Hallucination](../failure-modes/tool-hallucination.md)  
**Impact**: $5,000 in sanctions, legal precedent for AI misuse  
**Jurisdiction**: US District Court, Southern District of New York

## What Happened

Roberto Mata sued Avianca Airlines for injuries sustained when a serving cart allegedly struck his knee during a flight from El Salvador to New York in August 2019. When Avianca filed a motion to dismiss, Mata's lawyers submitted a brief opposing the motion that cited six legal cases as precedent.

The problem: None of the six cases existed. They were entirely fabricated by ChatGPT.

### The Fabricated Cases

The six non-existent cases cited in the legal brief:
1. **Varghese v. China South Airlines**
2. **Martinez v. Delta Airlines** 
3. **Shaboon v. EgyptAir**
4. **Petersen v. Iran Air**
5. **Miller v. United Airlines**
6. **Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines**

Each case included:
- Fake court names and docket numbers
- Fabricated internal citations and quotes
- Plausible-sounding legal reasoning
- Non-existent judicial opinions

## The Tool Failure

### How ChatGPT Was Used

Attorney Steven Schwartz, with 30+ years of legal experience, used ChatGPT to "supplement the legal research" for the brief. He treated ChatGPT as a "super search engine" and assumed it would only return real cases.

**Schwartz's Testimony**: "It just never occurred to me that it would be making up cases. My reaction was, 'ChatGPT is finding that case somewhere.' Maybe it's unpublished, maybe it was appealed, maybe access was difficult to access. I just never thought it could be made up."

### The Hallucination Pattern

ChatGPT generated cases that:
- **Followed Legal Patterns**: Used proper legal citation formats and case naming conventions
- **Seemed Plausible**: Involved real airlines and realistic legal scenarios
- **Included Details**: Complete with court names, dates, and legal reasoning
- **Appeared Authoritative**: Formatted like legitimate legal precedents

## Discovery and Legal Proceedings

### Initial Red Flags

Avianca's lawyers became suspicious when they couldn't locate any of the cited cases in legal databases. They asked for complete copies of the cases, which Mata's lawyers couldn't provide from legitimate sources.

### Court Investigation

**Judge Kevin Castel** investigated and found:
- All six cases "appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations"
- The cases included false judicial names and fabricated docket numbers
- ChatGPT had created entirely fictional legal precedents

### The Lawyers' Response

When confronted, the lawyers:
1. **Initially Denied**: Claimed the cases were real but difficult to access
2. **Asked ChatGPT for Verification**: Schwartz actually asked ChatGPT if the cases were real (it confirmed they were - another hallucination)
3. **Eventually Admitted**: Finally acknowledged using ChatGPT after the court's investigation

## Legal Consequences

### Sanctions Imposed

**Judge Kevin Castel** imposed sanctions on both lawyers:
- **Steven Schwartz**: $5,000 fine
- **Peter LoDuca**: $5,000 fine
- **Additional Requirements**:
  - Send copies of the sanctions ruling to Roberto Mata (the client)
  - Forward the ruling to each judge whom ChatGPT falsely identified as authors of the fake opinions

### Legal Reasoning

The court found evidence of **subjective bad faith**, noting:
- The lawyers exhibited "bad faith" by making false and misleading statements after concerns were raised
- LoDuca failed to read any of the cases or check the assertions before filing
- The lawyers didn't come "clean" about using ChatGPT until forced to by the court investigation

**Judge Castel's Quote**: "An inadequate or inattentive 'inquiry' may be unreasonable under the circumstances. But signing and filing that affirmation after making no 'inquiry' was an act of subjective bad faith."

## Case Outcome

### Underlying Lawsuit Dismissed

In a separate order, Judge Castel **granted Avianca's motion to dismiss** the underlying personal injury suit, finding that Mata's claim was filed after the expiration of the two-year window allowed under the Montreal Convention for international air travel claims.

### Legal Precedent Set

This case established important precedents:
- **Professional Responsibility**: Lawyers cannot blindly rely on AI tools for legal research
- **Verification Requirements**: All AI-generated content must be independently verified
- **Sanctions for AI Misuse**: Courts will impose penalties for negligent use of AI in legal practice

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Root Causes

1. **Lack of AI Understanding**
   - Lawyer treated ChatGPT as a search engine rather than a generative model
   - No understanding that AI can fabricate plausible-sounding information
   - Assumed AI would only return real cases

2. **No Verification Process**
   - Failed to cross-check AI output against legal databases (Westlaw, LexisNexis)
   - Didn't attempt to access the cases through normal legal channels
   - No independent validation of AI-generated citations

3. **Overconfidence in Technology**
   - Relied on AI without understanding its limitations
   - Assumed technological sophistication implied accuracy
   - Didn't consider possibility of fabricated content

### Professional Root Causes

1. **Insufficient Due Diligence**
   - Partner (LoDuca) signed brief without reading cited cases
   - No quality control process for AI-assisted research
   - Failure to follow standard legal research verification procedures

2. **Lack of AI Training**
   - No professional education about AI capabilities and limitations
   - Unfamiliarity with concepts like "hallucination" in AI systems
   - No institutional policies for AI use in legal practice

## Mitigation Strategies

### For Legal Professionals

1. **Verification Requirements**
```
AI Legal Research Protocol:
1. Use AI for initial research only
2. Verify ALL citations in primary legal databases
3. Read full text of every cited case
4. Cross-reference with multiple sources
5. Document verification process
```

2. **AI Disclosure Policies**
   - Mandatory disclosure of AI use in legal documents
   - Clear policies on acceptable AI applications
   - Training requirements for AI-assisted legal work

3. **Quality Control Systems**
   - Partner review of all AI-assisted work
   - Independent verification of citations
   - Regular audits of AI use in practice

### Technical Solutions

1. **Legal AI Tools with Verification**
```python
class VerifiedLegalResearch:
    def __init__(self, westlaw_api, lexis_api):
        self.westlaw = westlaw_api
        self.lexis = lexis_api
        
    def verify_case(self, case_citation):
        # Check multiple legal databases
        westlaw_result = self.westlaw.search(case_citation)
        lexis_result = self.lexis.search(case_citation)
        
        if not (westlaw_result.found and lexis_result.found):
            return {
                "verified": False,
                "warning": "Case not found in legal databases",
                "citation": case_citation
            }
        
        return {
            "verified": True,
            "case_details": westlaw_result.case_info,
            "multiple_sources": True
        }
```
